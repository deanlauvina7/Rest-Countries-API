## Welcome! 

Thanks for checking out my Rest Countries API Project

## The project

My goal for this project was to utilize an API to pull country data so people can retrieve information about a certain country. People can either look up a country in the search bar or filter out countries by region and find one that way.

When someone clicks on a country, a modal will pop up with additional information about the country.

This project also has the ability to toggle between light and dark modes.

## Tools I used 
HTMl, CSS, Javascript, API
